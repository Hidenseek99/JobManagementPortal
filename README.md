This readme should be treated as "WORK IN PROGRESS"

Up until now, we have made a Job Application Management System:

using ASP .NET MVC,
with database MSSQL Server
using Microsoft Identity framework(for authentication)
using Microsoft Entity Roles(for authorization)
using Microsoft EntityFramework 8.0.0

Until now, We have successfully implemented:

the Authentication and Authorization in the application
along with Login, 
Register, 
Logout, 
Remember Me, 
Job Application, 
and the Controller and Views for the above

We have taken a Code-First approach to construct the database and used Migrations for making any changes in the database schema.

To run the above application you need:

-an IIS server
-a web browser(preferably Microsoft Edge)
-dotnet 8.0 or VISUAL STUDIO 2022

Future Scope and Remaining Implementation:

1. Implementing a strong authentication such as JWT token.
2. Completing the project along with proper authorization.
3. Implementing bootstrap css in the application to ensure user-friendly behaviour.
4. Using Swal-Fire popups of MDN for interactive behaviour of the UI.

Feel free to share any suggestions regarding the project on
