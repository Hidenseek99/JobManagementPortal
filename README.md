This readme should be treated as "WORK IN PROGRESS"

Up until now, we have made a Job Application Management System:<br />
<br />
using ASP .NET MVC,<br />
with database MSSQL Server<br />
using Microsoft Identity framework(for authentication)<br />
using Microsoft Entity Roles(for authorization)<br />
using Microsoft EntityFramework 8.0.0<br />

Until now, We have successfully implemented:<br />
<br />
the Authentication and Authorization in the application<br />
along with Login, <br />
Register, <br />
Logout, <br />
Remember Me, <br />
Job Application, <br />
and the Controller and Views for the above<br />

We have taken a Code-First approach to construct the database and used Migrations for making any changes in the database schema.

To run the above application you need:<br />
<br />
-an IIS server<br />
-a web browser(preferably Microsoft Edge)<br />
-dotnet 8.0 or VISUAL STUDIO 2019/2022<br />

Future Scope and Remaining Implementation:<br />

1. Implementing a strong authentication such as JWT token.<br />
2. Completing the project along with proper authorization.<br />
3. Implementing bootstrap css in the application to ensure user-friendly behaviour.<br />
4. Using Swal-Fire popups of MDN for interactive behaviour of the UI.<br />
